🏴‍☠️  WELCOME TO THE BASH TREASURE HUNT  🏴‍☠️

Your mission: find the ONE treasure.txt that contains the secret phrase.

COMMANDS YOU'LL NEED:
  ls          — list what's in the current folder
  cd <folder> — move into a folder
  cd ..       — go back up one folder
  cat <file>  — read a file

Start by running:   ls

Good luck, pirate. The treasure is buried deep...
